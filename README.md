# Atmega32-lm35

I have developed a project that includes an ATmega32 microcontroller, an LM35 temperature sensor, an LCD display, and a power supply. The project reads the temperature from the sensor and displays it on the LCD screen. I also designed the PCB layout using Proteus. For programming the microcontroller, I used Atmel Studio IDE.
